# PowerShell Scripting

- PowerShell is the Windows Scripting Language and shell environment built using the **.NET** framework.
- Most PowerShell commands, called ***cmdlets**,* are written in .NET.
- Unlike other scripting languages and shell environments, the output of these *cmdlets* are objects - making PowerShell somewhat **object-oriented**.
- The normal format of a *cmdlet* is represented using **Verb-Noun**; for example, the *cmdlet* to list commands is called `**Get-Command**`
- The most important 2 commands are `**Get-Help**` and **`Get-Command`**
- **`Get-Help <CmdletName> -Online`** displays the online documentation for the specified cmdlet or topic.
- PowerShell scripts usually have the ***.ps1*** file extension.

# PowerShell scripting

## Commenting and Documentation

- In PowerShell, comments are denoted by the **`#`** (hash) symbol.
- Documentation can be provided as comments within your script or module, but it's often more structured and included in separate files or formats like Markdown, HTML, or XML.
- **`<# ... #>`** is commonly used for documentation in PowerShell scripts and functions.

## ****System Environment Variables****

- Environment variables store data that's used by the operating system and other programs.
- You can access environment variables in PowerShell using the **`env:`** drive.
- When you change environment variables in PowerShell, the change affects only the current session.

```powershell
ls env:\                      #list all environment variables
echo $env:USERNAME            #print username
echo $env:windir              #echo path to the Windows directory.
$env:MyVariable = "MyValue"   #sets a new environment variable.
echo $env:Path                #specify directories where executable files are located.
```

## ****Variables and Data Types****

- PowerShell infers the data type based on the assigned value.
- **Data Types:** PowerShell supports various data types, including: Strings, Integers, Floats, Booleans, Arrays, Hashtable, Null.
- Get variable type `$variable.GetType()`
- PowerShell can automatically convert between data types when necessary, based on the context.

```powershell
$result = 42

$name = "Alice"
$message = "Hello, $name!"  

$IsWorking = $true
Remove-Variable name         #name is removed 
```

## ****Arrays & Primitive Vs Non Primitive Data Types****

- Primitive data types represent basic, single values and are the building blocks of more complex data structures (integers, boolean, double).
- Non-primitive data types are more complex and can store multiple values(array, Hashtable, ArrayList, objects).
    - **Array(`@()`) :** An ordered collection of values, which can be of different data types.
        
        ```powershell
        $myarray = "Alice" , "Jhon" , 20 
        $myarray[1]                          #John
        $myarray.Length                      #3
        $myArray += "US"                     #Array contains "Alice" , "Jhon" , 20 , US
        $myarray[0].EndsWith("e")            #True
        $myarray.Contains("US")              #True
        ```
        
    - **Hashtable(`@{}`) :** A collection of key-value pairs.
        
        ```powershell
        $hash = @{ Number = 1; Shape = "Square"; Color = "Blue"}
        $hash["Size"] = 30                         #add Key Size with value 30
        $hash.Remove("Number")                     #remove key "Number"
        $hash.Count                                #number of key-value pairs => 3 (Number was removed)
        $hash.ContainsKey("Shape")                 #check if it contains a key called Shape => True
        $hash.ContainsValue("Green")               #check if it contains a value Green => False
        ```
        
    - **ArrayList :** A dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size.
        
        ```powershell
        $myArrayList = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList     #create an ArrayList
        $myArrayList.Add("EG")                                     # arraylist contains EG
        $myArrayList.Insert(0, "SU")                               #SU inserted at index 0 => SU , EG
        $myArrayList.Sort()                                        #sort arraylist => EG , SU
        $myArrayList.Remove("SU")                                  #SU is removed                                       
        $myArrayList.Clear()                                       # clear arraylist
        ```

    Get-Services >> System.txt         #append the output of Get-Services to System.txt
    Get-ChildItem | Where-Object { $_.Extension -eq ".txt" } | Sort-Object Length #pass the output of one command as the input to another command.
    ```
    
     **`-join`**  is used to concatenate an array of strings into a single string

        Write-Host "Access denied. You are a Guest and have restricted access."
    }
    ```
    
    ## ****Switch Statement****
    
    ```powershell
    Switch (<test-expression>)
    {
        <result1-to-be-matched> {<action>}
        <result2-to-be-matched> {<action>}
    }
    
    #Example
    
    $serviceName = "wuauserv"
    
    $serviceStatus = Get-Service -Name $serviceName
    
    switch ($serviceStatus.Status) {
        "Running" {
            Write-Host "$serviceName service is currently running. Stopping it..."
            Stop-Service -Name $serviceName -Force
            Write-Host "$serviceName service has been stopped."
        }
        "Stopped" {
            Write-Host "$serviceName service is currently stopped. Starting it..."
            Start-Service -Name $serviceName
            Write-Host "$serviceName service has been started."
        }

        }
    }
    ```
    
    ## ****Loop Statements****
    
    ### ****While****
    
    ```powershell
    while (<condition>) {
        # Code to be executed while the condition is true
    }
    
    #Example
    $countdown = 10
    Write-Host "Starting Countdown:"
    while ($countdown -ge 0) {
        Write-Host "$countdown"
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 1  
        $countdown--
    }
    Write-Host "Countdown Complete!"
    ```
    
    ### For
    
    ```powershell
    
    for ($i = 1; $i -le 5; $i++) {
        $fileName = "file$i.txt"
        Write-Host "Creating $fileName..."
    }
    ```
    
    ### Foreach
    
    ```powershell
    
    foreach ($item in $collection) {
        # Code to execute for each item
    }
    
    #loop on each file in directory and check if extension is png print filename
    foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem) {
    if ($file.Extension -eq ".png") {$file.name} }
    ```
    
    ## ****Functions in PowerShell****
    
    - created by keyword `**function**`
    - **`param`** block is used to define input parameters
    - in PowerShell the **`return`** statement to specify the value that a function should return.
    - Static Parameters: are suitable for functions where the number and type of parameters are known in advance
    - Dynamic Parameters: are useful when you want the parameter names or data types to change depending on the situation. Dynamic parameters are defined using the **`DynamicParam`**
    
    ```powershell
    function Add-Numbers {
        Param( [int]$a, [int]$b)
        $result = $a + $b
        Write-host $result
    }
    #if int is not spicified a & b will be treated as string  
    
    #CALL Function by two ways
    Add-Numbers -a 8 -b 1         
    Add-Numbers 8 1 
    
    ```
    
    ```powershell
    function Add-Numbers {
        Param( [int]$a = 5, [int]$b = 12 )
        $result = $a + $b 
        Write-host $result
    }
    ```
    
    - you can define parameters for your functions or cmdlets as **mandatory**, which means that the user must provide a value for these parameters when calling the function
        
        ```powershell
        function My-Function {
            param (
                **[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]**
                [int] $MandatoryParameter , [Parameter ()] [int] $N
        
            )
        
         Write-Host "Mandatory parameter is $MandatoryParameter"
         Write-Host "NOT Mandatory parameter is $N " 
        }

    - When you define P**osition** parameters for a function or cmdlet, you can call that function or cmdlet and provide values for those parameters in a specific order, without needing to specify parameter names.
        
        ```powershell
        function My-Function {
            param (
                [Parameter(Position=1)]
                [int] $Param1,
        
                [Parameter(Position=0)]
                [int] $Param2
            )
        #block of code  
        }
        
        #The first input you provide when calling My-Function will be assigned to $Param2 because it has a position of 0
        #the second input will be assigned to $Param1 because it has a position of 1.
        ```
